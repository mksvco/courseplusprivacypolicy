# Privacy Policy for Course+

At **Course+**, we believe your data belongs to you. That’s why we’ve built our app to work without collecting, storing, or transmitting any personal data to our servers. We don’t track you, and we don’t share or sell any information — because we don’t have it.

## Information We Do Not Collect

Course+ does **not** collect:
- Your name, email address, or any personal identifiers  
- Your workout history, performance data, or fitness metrics  
- Your location or GPS data  
- Any analytics, crash reports, or device identifiers  
- Any data from the Apple Health app  
- Any data stored on your device

## HealthKit and Apple Health

Course+ optionally integrates with Apple Health through HealthKit to:
- Save completed workouts  
- Record metrics such as heart rate, distance, duration, and calories burned

This data is stored securely on your device and only shared with Apple Health **if you give permission**. Course+ does **not** access any Health data unless you explicitly allow it, and we do **not** transmit this data anywhere outside your device.

## Location Services

If you choose to enable GPS tracking for pace and distance:
- Location data is used **only during workouts**  
- It is processed locally on your device  
- It is not stored after the workout, unless saved to Apple Health (with your permission)

We do **not** track or access your location at any other time.

## Offline Functionality

Course+ works entirely offline after initial setup. All your progress, settings, and data remain on your device. There is no account creation, no cloud sync, and no internet connection required during use.
